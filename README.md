# Project Summary: Bank Loan Report and Power BI Dashboard

## Overview:
In this project, I developed a comprehensive Bank Loan Report dashboard aimed at providing valuable insights into a bank's lending activities. The report was designed to monitor key loan-related metrics, track trends over time, and assist in data-driven decision-making. The project involved analyzing data, calculating essential KPIs, and creating visualizations to offer a clear understanding of the bank's loan portfolio health.

## Objectives:
The primary goal of this project was to create an interactive and insightful dashboard that could:
- **Track Loan Performance:** Monitor total loan applications, funded amounts, and repayments over specified periods.
- **Assess Loan Quality:** Differentiate between "Good Loans" (e.g., fully paid, current) and "Bad Loans" (e.g., charged off) to evaluate the quality of the loan portfolio.
- **Visualize Loan Trends:** Use various charts and maps to highlight trends in loan applications, funded amounts, and repayments across different time periods, regions, and loan categories.
- **Provide Detailed Insights:** Offer a detailed view of loan data, including borrower profiles and loan performance metrics, to facilitate in-depth analysis and strategic planning.

## Key Features:
- **KPI Tracking:** Calculated and displayed critical metrics such as Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average Debt-to-Income Ratio. These KPIs were monitored month-to-date (MTD) and analyzed for month-over-month (MoM) changes.
- **Good vs. Bad Loans:** Created separate KPIs for "Good Loans" and "Bad Loans" to help assess the performance and risk associated with different segments of the loan portfolio.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Developed various charts, including:
  - **Line Chart:** Showed monthly trends in loan applications, funded amounts, and repayments.
  - **Filled Map:** Illustrated lending activity across different states.
  - **Donut Chart:** Analyzed loan terms and their distribution.
  - **Bar Charts:** Provided insights into the impact of employment length and loan purpose on lending metrics.
  - **Tree Map:** Visualized the relationship between home ownership status and loan disbursements.

## Analysis and Visualization:
The data analysis and visualization were performed using Microsoft Power BI. An additional QC of the results and KPI calculations was completed using SQL queries and Python.

## Outcome:
The Bank Loan Report dashboard successfully provided a comprehensive view of the bank's lending operations, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on real-time data. The project demonstrated my ability to handle complex datasets, create meaningful visualizations, and provide actionable insights through data analysis.
